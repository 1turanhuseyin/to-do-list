# to-do-list
I created a To Do List using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In this project;
-You can add the tasks you want to do to your list by typing them in the input section and clicking the plus button or pressing the enter key.
-You can cross off the tasks you have completed by pressing the tick button.
-You can see your completed and uncompleted tasks in separate lists.
-You can delete completed tasks by pressing the trash can button.
-Even if you refresh the page, you can see your tasks in your list.
-As usual, I placed my LinkedIn account in a corner of the project. Stay tuned :)
